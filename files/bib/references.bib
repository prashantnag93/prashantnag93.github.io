	abstract = {Detection of Emotions from the text is a tedious task. Presently, existing models failed to detect the emotion in absence of the emotional word in the text. The cause phrase selection which gives a deep insight into emotions is considered to be a tough task. The proposed model for detecting emotions is developed through seven layers. Initially, the dataset is represented in the Topical documents using Adversarial Topic Modelling (ATM). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) maps each phrase in the topical document to Higher-dimensional vectors, followed by the ELMo Model to obtain the fixed word Embeddings vectors. LSTM is responsible for making the interaction between the words in word embeddings and produces the context and query vectors. The bi-directional Attention flow layer determines the most relevant similarity between Context and Query. Finally, Robustly Optimized BERT (RoBERT) architecture is used to detect the Emotion. It is noted that the proposed multi-stage model detects better emotions than all the existing state-of-art models for detecting emotions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the proposed approach categories the sentences in the dataset into the various topical documents using the TE-LSTM+SC model. As well as, the model generates semantic words related to topics that are fed into the word embedding like Skip-Gram and FrameNet to build the domain-specific lexicon. The topically related sentences in each document are contextually grouped using Skip-Phrase. Each sentence in contextual group is given to Semantic Role Labelling (SRL). SRL indentify the essential predicate-argument structures with the semantic labels like verb (V) tag or ARGM-NEG or ARGM-PRP or ARGM-CAU or structures with the semantic labels like verb (V) tag or ARGM-NEG or ARGM-PRP or ARGM-CAU or ARGM-MNR or ARGM-MOD. The selected predicate-argument structures are aggregated into a linear layer to form a semantic embedding. Simultaneously, the predicate-argument embedding is segmented to sub words by BERT. The sub-words are transformed to word level through a convolutional layer to acquire the contextual word representation. Finally, semantic embedding and word representation are integrated to efficiently find the emotion of the given sentence. The experimental result proved that the proposed approach outperforms all the state-of-art approaches.},

	abstract = {In the task of small object detection, limitations such as fewer pixels, lack of rich features, and difficulty in feature extraction often lead to issues like missed detections, false detections, and low accuracy in models. To address these issues, a small object detection algorithm based on multi-scale structure-aware and global context information is proposed. A multi-scale structure-aware module is designed for complex scenarios to better capture the detailed features of small objects, thereby enhancing the model's ability to detect objects of different sizes. To obtain more global features, a global context information module is designed using the advantages of Transformers in capturing long-range dependency features, effectively establishing connections between pixel points in different regions. To address the gradient explosion phenomenon during model training, a new weighted loss function, W-FIoU, is designed, significantly improving the convergence speed during training. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better detection results compared to other classic lightweight methods. Compared to the benchmark model, the proposed model improves mAP50 and mAP50:95 by 6.4 and 4.6 percentage points respectively on the VisDrone dataset, and also performs well on the TinyPerson dataset.},

	abstract = {This systematic literature review (SLR) investigates how AI, deep learning (DL), and emotional analysis have been implemented/used in healthcare, and how they have influenced patient care and outcomes. AI techniques include methods of AI in diagnosis that have displayed undeniable promise in the areas of correct diagnosis, treatment plans that are individualized, and patient-therapist interaction. The review includes studies from 2014 to 2024, that explore the various sub-fields, including general healthcare, mental health, chronic disorders, and emergency care. It approves the main fields of deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis and emotion detection in healthcare and the high accuracy of the applications and other issues such as data quality, privacy concerns, model explainability, and assimilation into current healthcare systems. The study of emotional recognition is one such example of research that shows it is the application of AI models in emotional assessments done in real-time and detecting mental health conditions. Nevertheless, ethical and privacy issues are what make it difficult, thus, it is determined that proper consideration for data security and the public's confidence in artificial intelligence are required to solve the issues. The study concludes that further research should be conducted in the fields of data quality improvement and AI model explainability development and that AI systems should be interoperable within healthcare infrastructures. Nevertheless, even though there are barriers, AI and emotional analysis gives healthcare the capability of new patient outcome improvements and even more personalized care.},

The primary aim of this investigation is to thoroughly evaluate the influence of AI technology on patient care by analyzing emotional processes and enabling patient-centered solutions. In this research, we investigate the cognitive and emotional approaches to sentiment analysis and other modeling and forecasting methods using AI. Primary sources include patients’ reviews, online health exchanges and doctors’ narratives. Key aspects of the present state of affairs are advances in the development of machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition, intracellular fusion of cognitive and affective modes of analysis, and the application of artificial intelligence for the enhancement of clinical support systems. Moreover, these technologies have significantly improved individualized clinical approaches, expedited the early identification of mental health problems, and strengthened the rationale for therapeutic treatments. Despite recent advancements, the discipline still faces numerous persistent obstacles. Pressing issues include the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence, the need to protect patient privacy, and the complexity of detecting biases in algorithms. Nevertheless, the impact of AI on healthcare practices is indisputable, indicating a future marked by a more intelligent, efficient, empathetic, and patient-centered healthcare system.
