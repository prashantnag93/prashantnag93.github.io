::: about-link-text
I am an early-career researcher specializing in **artificial intelligence**, **deep learning**, and **affective computing**, with a particular focus on emotion detection, cognitive appraisal, and explainable AI. My work explores how AI models interpret human emotions in text and how transparent analytical methods can improve understanding, reliability, and human-centered applications. I am committed to developing rigorous, reproducible, and interpretable AI techniques while contributing to research, teaching, and collaborative academic growth.
