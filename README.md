# Personal Academic Website

Source files for Prashant Kumar Nag's personal website, built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

## About

This website showcases my research, publications, talks, and software projects in Human Emotion Recognition and related fields.

## Built With

- **[Quarto](https://quarto.org)** - Static site generator
- **SCSS** - Custom styling
- **Quarto Extensions** - Iconify, Font Awesome, Academicons

## Acknowledgments

This website's design and structure draws inspiration from two excellent academic websites:

### Design & Styling
Primary inspiration from **[Andrew Heiss's website](https://github.com/andrewheiss/ath-quarto)**:
- Custom SCSS styling system (`html/ath.scss`)
- Badge components for links (PDF, DOI, arXiv, etc.)
- Custom EJS listing templates for publications
- Category and listing styling
- Color scheme and button designs

### Structure & Organization
Secondary inspiration from **[Rob Hyndman's website](https://github.com/robjhyndman/robjhyndman.com)**:
- Overall Quarto website architecture
- Academic content organization (CV, Publications, Talks)
- Typography choices (Fira Sans, Merriweather)
- Publication categorization approach

Both repositories are excellent examples of academic websites built with Quarto and served as valuable references during development.
